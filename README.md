# A quick intro to Dash and Plotly
A **Dash** app is defined as components that are displayed on the page through the **Layout** which interact with each other through the **Callback**. This repository aims to provide initial insight and technical skills to develop interactive apps using Plotly for visualisation and Dash.

In order to fulfill this aim, we need to identify 3 main concepts which serve as the basis of any Dash app:
* **Components**: date pickers, checkboxes, etc.
* **Layout**: allows to customise how the components are displayed on the page
* **Callback**: what allows the app to be fully functional and interactive

In order to follow this session's sequence of pieces of code, please consider the next order:
1. `hello_dash.py`
2. `interactive_dash.py`
3. `app_with_graph.py`
4. `map_choroplet.py`
